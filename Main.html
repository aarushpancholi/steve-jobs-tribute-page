              <h3>Here's a timeline of Steve Jobs' life:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><b>1955 - </b>Born in San Francisco.</li>
                <li><b>1968 - </b>Starts attending Homestead High as his high school.</li>
                <li><b>1972 - </b>Enrolls at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.</li>
                <li><b>1973 - </b>Drops out of Reed College.</li>
                <li><b>1974 - </b>Jobs returns to his parents' hoe in Los Altos and began looking for a job. He was soon hired by Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, Califronia which gave him a job as a technician.</li>
                <li><b>1975 - </b>Jobs and Steve Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer club which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer. </li>
                <li><b>1976 - </b>Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it.</li>
                <li><b>1977 - </b>Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire.</li>
                <li><b>1984 - </b>Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly ethusiastic audience at Apple's annual shareholders meeting.</li>
                <li><b>1985 - </b>Jobs resigns from Apple as Jobs was effectively rendered powerless within Apple due to the reorganization of Apple that proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of "New Product Development". Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc. A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon.</li>
                <li><b>1986 - </b>Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights.</li>
                <li><b>1996 - </b>Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million. The deal was finalized in February 1997, bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded. Jobs became <i>de facto</i> chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997.</li>
                <li><b>1998 - </b>Apple iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's."</li>
                <li><b>2003 - </b>Jobs was diagnosed with cancer.</li>
                <li><b>2004 - </b>He announced to his employees that he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas. The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is usually very poor; Jobs stated that he had a rare, much less aggressive type, known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor.</li>
                <li><b>2005 - </b>Apple began work on the first iPhone.</li>
                <li><b>2007 - </b>The first iPhone was released. The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release.<i>Time</i> declared it the "Invention of the Year".</li>
                <li><b>2009 - </b>Jobs wrote in an internal Apple memo that in the previous week he had "learned that my health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought". He announced a six-month leave of absence until the end of June 2009, to allow him to better focus on his health. Tim Cook, who previously acted as CEO in Jobs's 2004 absence, became acting CEO of Apple, with Jobs still involved with "major strategic decisions". Later, Tim Cook offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, since both share a rare blood type and the donor liver can regenerate tissue after such an operation. Jobs yelled, "I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that."</li>
                <li><b>2011 - </b>A year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, Aple annoucned that he had been granted a medical leave of abscence. After a few otnhs, Jobs announced his resignation as Apple's CEO. Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO. Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death at his Palo Alto, California home at around 3 p.m. at the age of 65.</li>

                <p>"Steve was among the greatest of American innovators - brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it. The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented."</p>
